# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application can be used by travelers who want to outlook the weather for multiple cities and plan their trips accordingly. This webpage is created through the use of HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, jQuery, and JavaScript. However, it truly relies on the use of the OpenWeather geocoding and 5 day forecast API's.

The geocoding API is used to retrieve the coordinates from the user inputted city. The 5 day forecast API then uses the lattitude and longitude coordinates to retrieve and ultimately display the forecast for the following 5 days.
